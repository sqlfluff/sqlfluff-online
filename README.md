This repo contains an online SQLFluff formatter. It's useful for those who want to format one-off, adhoc sql that isn't worth saving to a file. You can also use it to see how fluff would format your queries.

You can use the application on [online.sqlfluff.com](https://online.sqlfluff.com/)! Enjoy.
